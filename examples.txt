List of things to syntaxify (desymbolize)

- Haskell
  - things that use Lens / Parsec
  - the file (syntax.hs) itself
- Lisp
- C
- Java
- Perl
- Ramsey Nasser's Arabic programming language
- Emojinal
- English
- Brainfuck
- LaTeX
- actual math (LaTeXed maybe)
- webpages

Motivation:

English language: I'm interested in mapping the silences.
Code: The media often fetishizes the syntax of code. e.g. <b>, test;, obj.thing();
Math: I'm interested in the exotic kinds of notation that we define for abstractions.
In general: I'm interested in the distinction between symbols and syntax,
  especially the unpronouncable. The symbol "beta" can be said right away.
  What about (<*>)? You can only say the names of the things that constitute it.
  I'd like to highlight and center the work of the syntax.

Next up: synbols without syntax.
